workflow implementation through enums?

Goals
1. implement theoretical workflow (using enums) without using a workflow system such as activiti
2. implement versioning and tie a workflow execution to a specific version
3. support multiple workflow versions running side-by-side
   1. default
   2. remaining versions to support existing workflow executions that have not completed / for reference to show the steps they have taken in the past?

Actions
1. prepare interfaces for workflow steps
2. implement workflow steps with enums for a sample / theoretical workflow
3. implement business logic to support any workflow / validation / etc.
4. implement sample workflow such as approval, access approval, provisioning, etc.



0. authenticate
1. raise request / UI is available to selected user / create request entity is created
2. user approves request or components of the request
3. request is fulfilled

Request:
 Principal
 Resource / Action pair
    1. grant the user group / default role
    2. grant the user access to the specified system

Approval:
 approve single Resource / Action pairs
  1. approve item #1, bypass (ignore) #2

Provisioning:
 provision resource / action pairs (as they're approved)

@refence Java EE batch, very similar concepts
